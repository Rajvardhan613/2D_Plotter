# 2D_Plotter
This project involves the design of a 2D plotter, a device capable of drawing precise two-dimensional shapes and patterns on a surface using controlled movements of a pen. The 2D plotter operates by interpreting vector-based input, which is then translated into coordinated movements along the X and Y axes.
